    <p>Getting absorbed in the world of fiction or a world clearly trying to describe some part in some abstract way is one of the things I like about reading. Learning some vocabulary and some lessons intended by the writer is another thing I like. Of the two genres of literature, fiction and non-fiction, I like the fiction way better and prefer it above all else. Getting to see on creator describing their world and wiring some consequences on the fictitious character just thrills me. </p>
