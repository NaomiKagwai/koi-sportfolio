    <p>Most of my time I am a student at Moi University, pursuing the course of Bachelor of Education (Arts). I believe it to be my calling, not only do I get to be a teacher but also I will be teaching one of the most genre that I so adore, literature and as much as a cherry on top teach English. But apart from being a student I am pursuing a career in Web Development and Web Design. </p>
